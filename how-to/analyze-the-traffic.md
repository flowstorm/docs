# Analyze the traffic

You can easily track all traffic in your Space in the "Data" menu section.

## Track individual conversations in "Sessions"

In _**Data >> Sessions**_, you will find the transcripts of individual conversations. In Flowstorm, conversations are called _sessions_.

* The list on the left shows, by default, the most recent sessions. To see a different group of sessions or to find a specific session, use the magnifying glass icon or the "Quick search" box.
* In the list, find the session you are interested in, and click on it. The right panel will show its detail.
* In the right panel, below the technical details, you can see the transcript. You can choose between different transcript types: **Utterances**,** Turns** (both with clickable items containing more details), **Run Log** (with runtime logs), or **Text** (simple text transcript).

## Track errors in "Dialogue Events"

The _**Data >> Dialogue Events**_ page will be useful especially as a list of runtime errors.

Click on an item to see the technical details; the key information is usually the description of the error in the "Text" box.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The list doesn't show ALL errors: for example, _client errors_ (such as problems with the microphone) occur before communication reaches our server, therefore they are not registered and cannot be tracked in Flowstorm.

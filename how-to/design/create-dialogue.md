  On Flowstorm, the primary level of conversation design lies in designing
  "dialogue models". How do you create one?

# Create a Dialogue Model

1. Go to _**Design**_** >> **_**Dialogues**_ (or use the [keyboard shortcut](https://docs.promethist.ai/app/keyboard-shortcuts) **d**).
2. A new default dialogue model should **open automatically** in a tab.\
   ****If you were already inside the editor, click on _**Model**_** >> **_**New**_**â€¦** and a new dialogue model will open in a new tab.
3. To **change the name** of the dialogue model, open the tab _**Properties**_, find the "_**Name**_" box and write the name in the format _**`xxx/yyy`**_ (no spaces or special characters).
4. Make sure to **Save** your dialogue model\
   by clicking on the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (95).png>) button in the left panel.
5. You can start [designing](https://docs.promethist.ai/how-to/design/design-dialogue)!

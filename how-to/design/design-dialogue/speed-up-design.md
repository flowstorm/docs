# Insert a group of nodes

Nobody wants to spend their time designing the same structure again and again, node by node. That's why Flowstorm offers you a simple tool to speed up your designing process: introducing **dialogue snippets**!

* Design faster, be more productive.
* Reduce repetitive work.
* Make your dialogues more robust by using built-in dialogue snippets.
* Create custom snippets that suit your needs.

## Insert a predefined structure

To insert an existing dialogue snippet:

1. In the left panel of the "Dialogues" editor, click on the **"Snippets" tab**.
2. Select a snippet from the list and **drag and drop** it onto the canvas.
3. Add, remove, modify, or connect the inserted nodes just like any other.

{% hint style="success" %}
Snippets are templates â€“ once you insert a snippet, you can modify anything without modifying the source. If you _do_ want to modify the source snippet (or create a new one), use the ["Snippets" editor](../../../studio/main-menu/design/snippet-designer.md). Also, see this page below.
{% endhint %}

## Create or modify your own reusable snippet

See [**this article**](../../../studio/main-menu/design/snippet-designer.md).

{% hint style="success" %}
Similar to other objects (dialogue models, file assets...), snippets are created "per Space", so they will be shared with all your Space collaborators.
{% endhint %}

# Detect dialogue acts

In NLP, "dialogue acts" refer to the intentions or actions conveyed through the words people use in a conversation. It's like the hidden meaning behind what they say. For example, if someone asks _"What time is it?"_, the dialogue act might be a _request for information_. By analyzing dialogue acts, your persona can better understand what the user means.

Flowstorm technology allows you to detect a predefined set of dialogue acts. If you want to use this advanced feature, please **contact our technical support**.

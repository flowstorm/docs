# Dialogue Designer

The Flowstorm editor is a tool which serves for creating, saving and building the dialogue models. It is available at [https://app.flowstorm.ai](https://app.flowstorm.ai).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To get into Dialogue Designer, click on **Design** item in the top menu and choose **Dialogue Designer** or just press key **"d"** as a **keyboard shortcut**.
{% endhint %}

You can **open** as many **models for editing** (or observing) as you want in paralel. Anytime you create or open a new dialogue model you will get a **new tab** with a new **independent editor**.

### Graphic User Interface

The **Graph** view provides you with the powerful user interface that allows model creating & editing. Elements can be added and organized by drag & drop interface. The right panel allows you to fill the content, code (where applicable) and/or set the node preferences like Label, Name, references to Mixins and Entities.

### Tabs - Editors

In the following picture you can see the admin with two editors opened.

{% hint style="info" %}
A tabs reflect the statuses and changes of the dialogue models.
{% endhint %}

* **The first one** (habits/relax)
  * **Active tab** - white background
  * **Edited** - title is in **bold font**
  * **User is not editing now** - the **edit icon** on the left is **inactive** & the **grid** behind the canvas is hidden
  * **Not built** yet - missing checkmark
* **The second one** (pre-example/example)
  * **Built - checkmark** next to the title
  * **Not edited** - title is not in **bold font**

### Basic controls  <a href="#basic-controls" id="basic-controls"></a>

Main area/canvas can be dragged by clicking and moving a mouse or zoomed by holding **Control** and scrolling the mouse wheel. Multiple nodes can be selected by holding a mouse button then dragging a select box over them. Nodes or groups of nodes and links can be duplicated by the shortcuts **Control + C** and **Control + V** (**Command** on Mac) ; however, note that the duplicated nodes will appear on top of the originals so they wonâ€™t be immediately visible. The designer can then drag them to a desired position. The copying can be done between open windows of the editor, but make sure you have focus on the main editing area. If the pasting does not work, try closing and reopening the tab or window you are attempting to paste to.

#### Graph - Main editing area and palette  <a href="#graph---main-editing-area-and-palette" id="graph---main-editing-area-and-palette"></a>

A **dialogue graph** is created by dragging node (or a group of nodes) from the palette on the left to the main editing area.&#x20;

Transitions between nodes can be created by holding a mouse over a port (small squeare visible when putting the mouse cursor over a node) and dragging the link to another port.

#### Workflow

{% hint style="info" %}
The lifecycle of the dialogue: _New_ -> _Draft_ -> _Published_ -> _Archived_
{% endhint %}

The workflow of your specific dialogue can be different. Let's have a look at each state.

* New - unsaved
* Draft - saved, editable, can be shared via an application
* Published - saved, non-editable
* Archived - saved, non-editable

If someone else left the window with editor open this is the screen where you can **Force unlock** on this tab.&#x20;

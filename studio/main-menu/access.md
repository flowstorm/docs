# Access

## [**Applications**](https://app.flowstorm.ai/#!/space/applications) <a href="#collaboration-e2-80-93-space" id="collaboration-e2-80-93-space"></a>

Create and administer applications. In Flowstorm, an _application_ is the "packaging" of a specific set of dialogues; **the application is what you can share with your end-users**.

Important to note:

* **Main dialogue** – which dialogue launches when the application is opened
* <mark style="background-color:green;">**Web bot URL**</mark> – this link (generated after you've created the application) can be easily shared with your users or testers
* **Anonymous access allowed** – enabling is necessary if you want to allow anyone to try your application via the URL link
* **Public** – the application will be displayed in the list of public applications in the Flowstorm mobile app (discontinued product)

{% hint style="success" %}
You can also **try the application by clicking on the "Test run" button** in the lower part of the screen (similar to the Dialogues editor).
{% endhint %}

  Create and modify reusable dialogue graph snippets. You won't need to create
  the same structure again and again â€“ you can just easily drag&drop a copy of a
  pre-made snippet into any dialogue.

# Snippets (editor)

## Create a snippet

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/snippet-question.jpg)

* Open **Design** > **Snippets**
* Create a graph structure or copy and paste a proven structure from existing dialogue
* Switch from Graph to **Properties** tab and give it a name (see example below)
* **Save** the snippet by the **save button** on the left

### Use an existing snippet

Saved snippets can be inserted **into the graph** in the Dialogues editor via drag\&drop from the snippet palette when you are editing the dialogue.

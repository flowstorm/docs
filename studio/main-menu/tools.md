## [Dialogue Bulk Builder](https://app.flowstorm.ai/#!/space/rebuild)

This tool allows you to **build multiple dialogues** **at once**.

1. In the Search box, type the string that is present in all the names of the desired dialogues.
2. Click on Dry Run – the list of the dialogues ready to be bulk-built will appear in the lower part of the screen.
3. Click on Build – the dialogues will be built, automatically one by one.
4. The details from the Build log will continuously appear in the lower part of the screen.
5. If some of the dialogues were not successfully built, you will need to open those dialogues manually and make necessary edits.

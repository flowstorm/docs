# Standalone Application

Standalone application can be used on any device with operating system for which Java JRE version 8 or later is available \(e.g. Windows, MacOS, various Linux distributions\). This makes it useful for prototyping custom device solutions. You can use Oracle or OpenJDK distribution of Java JRE.

Latest stable version can be downloaded [here](https://repository.promethist.ai/dist/) as Java ARchive \(JAR\) file which can be executed using [command line interface](command-line-interface.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend using Java JRE version 8 \(Oracle or OpenJDK\). Newer version can have certain problems with specific functionalities \(e.g. screen visualisations based on JavaFX technology\) therefore we do not officially support them yet.

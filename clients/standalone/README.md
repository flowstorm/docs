# Standalone Application

The standalone application can be used on any device with an operating system for which Java JRE version 11 or later is available (e.g. Windows, MacOS, and various Linux distributions). This makes it useful for prototyping custom device solutions. You can use Oracle or OpenJDK distribution of Java JRE.

The latest stable version can be downloaded [here](https://repository.promethist.ai/dist/) as Java ARchive (JAR) file, which can be executed using [command line interface](command-line-interface.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend using Java JRE version 11 (Oracle or OpenJDK).

Initially, only public applications are available. If you are registered in the Promethist platform, you can **Log in** using the button in the menu in the upper right corner of the screen. After that, you will be able to use applications which were assigned to you.

#### Talking to the bot

If the conversation does not start immediately, check your connection and also the option "**Run dialog after start**" in the settings.

The rectangle with the Promethist logo indicates the state which the bot is currently in:

* Gray means that the bot is idle or responding
* Green means that the bot is open for your input. You can either speak or use the text input field. Both options are disabled if the bot is not listening
* Blue means that the bot either processes your input or that it is paused

When the bot is responding, you can&#x20;

* **skip** the current response by **tapping the area with the logo** or&#x20;
* **pause** the response by **long pressing** it (tap again to resume).&#x20;

#### Settings

Access the settings in the left-hand panel which opens upon tapping the hamburger menu on the left.

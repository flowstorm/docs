# What is Flowstorm

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv8CQrJoeKI" %}

The **Flowstorm** conversational platform is provided as a **platform as a service (PaaS)** and consists of several SaaS development tools and software components for creating **conversational & multimodal applications** with **AI-powered digital personas**.

### Design via drag\&drop and code

Flowstorm allows you to create smart voice applications in a **drag & drop UI** (predefined nodes or complex dialogue assets) combined with a code-editing environment to control more sophisticated application logic using the programming language **Kotlin**.&#x20;

### Easily test and analyze

You can test your apps **seconds after you've created them** and detect problems immediately. Flowstorm also comes with **built-in analytics**: analyze the users' behavior and find what works and what doesn't. Learn from the traffic and enhance the performance of the app. Inspect each conversation, including technical details.

### Access from different environments

Flowstorm provides integrations to different **channels and clients**. We also provide an open-source template to write custom integration to any device with a speaker and microphone. Flowstorm also supports ASR and TTS from major providers (Amazon, Google, Microsoft).

### Collaborate and share

Flowstorm is ready for collaborative design. Share your dialogues and conversational assets **with your team**. Different team members can work on different pieces of the app. Distribute the app to testers and analyze their feedback.

### Combine flow control with generative AI

In Flowstorm, you can seamlessly combine predetermined conversation flows with state-of-the-art generative models. The former gives you **control** over your personas' behavior, the latter enables personas to talk **freely and flexibly**.

### Work with context

Context is the key to creating **personalized and adaptive dialogues**. Your Flowstorm app will be able to adapt to the context of the session, the user, or even a community of users.

### Deploy open-source runtime on-premise

We provide open-source for the Core and a template for clients. The **Core** is the **major runtime component**. It can be installed in any cloud or on-premise. The client template is a starting point to write integrations for any device.

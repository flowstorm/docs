The **Flowstorm** platform is provided as a **platform as a service (PaaS**) and consists of several SaaS development tools and software components for **creating smart conversational & multimodal AI** applications.

### Create Voice First App with Drag & Drop UI

Author a complex VoiceFirst application with a simple drag & drop UI. Rely on predefined, tested, and proven dialog parts. Sub-dialogs, mixins, snippets, and topics are like Lego parts designed for fast and easy development. Includes pictures and recorded voices. Use Kotlin to control the application logic.

### Test It in a Minute

The Flowstorm comes with built-in analytics. Analyze users' behavior and find problematic dialogs. Learn from the traffic. Enhance the performance of the app. Inspect the session details. Inspect the sessions, including confidence score. Tune the application.

### Access Everywhere - Mobile, Desktop, VR...

Just build once and access  The platform provides integrations to **Alexa, Google Nest, iPhone, Android, WEB, Unreal Engine, POTS, and Twilio**. We also provide an open-source template to write custom integration to any device with a speaker and microphone. The Flowstorm also supports ASR and TTS from major providers (Amazon, Google, Microsoft).

### Collaboration and Sharing

The Flowstorm is ready for collaborative design. Share and copy the dialogs with your team. Take advantage of sub-dialogs to enable team members to work on separate pieces of code and letting them add his/her part to the entire artwork. Distribute the app to testers and analyze the feedback.

### Use Knowledge - Use Rich Context

Context is the key to creating personalized and adaptive dialogs. We have introduced attributes with different scopes. The user attribute is the best for building the user profile. The session dialog suits the application context. We offer the Kotlin programing language to process and manipulate any parts of the dialog.

### Deploy Open Source Runtime On-Premise

We provide open-source for the Core and a template for clients. The **Core** is the **major runtime component**. It can be installed in any cloud or on-premise. The client template is a starting point to write integrations for any device.

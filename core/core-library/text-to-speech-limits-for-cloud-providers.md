# Text-to-speech Limits for Cloud Providers

Limits change from time to time however it is good to know what the limits are \(were\)

**Microsoft**

* Max Audio length produced per turn 10 min/64kB
* Functional testing example: 4 speech nodes in a row containing 7200 characters each - You need to wait a few seconds for processing but it works well overall.

**Amazon \(Polly\)**

* Allows synthesis of 3000 characters as maximum for a speech node

**Google**

* Allows synthesis of 5000 characters as maximum for a speech node
